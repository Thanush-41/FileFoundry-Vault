# QA and UAT Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the Quality Assurance (QA) and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) methodology implemented for the FileFoundry application. Our testing approach focuses on comprehensive API testing with automated PowerShell scripts to ensure high-quality functionality and production readiness.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Test Pyramid Approach

```
    /\
   /  \
  / UI \    <- Manual Testing
 /______\
/        \   <- API Tests (PowerShell UAT Scripts)
/__________\  <- Unit Tests (Jest, Go tests)
```

### 2. Testing Types Implemented

#### Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Frontend (Jest/React Testing Library) and Backend (Go testing)
- **API Integration Tests**: Comprehensive PowerShell-based UAT testing
- **Component Tests**: Individual React component testing

#### Manual Testing
- **Exploratory Testing**: Ad-hoc testing for edge cases and usability
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Real user scenarios and feedback
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Compatibility across different browsers
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance and screen reader compatibility
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing and response time validation

## PowerShell UAT Testing Suite

### Why PowerShell UAT Scripts?

1. **Comprehensive API Coverage**: Tests all 41 critical API endpoints
2. **Real Backend Integration**: Direct API calls to running services
3. **Production-like Testing**: Uses actual authentication and data
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Color-coded results with detailed error reporting
5. **CI/CD Ready**: Can be integrated into automated pipelines
6. **Zero Dependencies**: No additional frameworks or browser installations needed

## Running UAT Tests

### Prerequisites
```powershell
# Ensure all services are running
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are healthy
docker-compose ps
```

### Execute Complete Test Suite
```powershell
# Run all 41 tests with comprehensive reporting
.\uat-api-tests.ps1
```

### Run Individual Test Commands
```powershell
# Execute specific API test commands
.\api-test-commands.ps1
```

### Test Results
- **Real-time colored output**: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL indicators
- **Detailed error reporting**: Specific failure reasons
- **Summary statistics**: Pass rate and failed test details
- **JSON export**: Automated result export for CI/CD integration
- **Rate limiting protection**: Automatic retry mechanisms

## Production Readiness Validation

## Continuous Integration

The PowerShell UAT test suite can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for:
- **Automated regression testing**
- **Production deployment validation**

  run: |
    docker-compose up -d
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 30
    .\uat-api-tests.ps1
  shell: powershell
```
