# User Experience Enhancements - Rate Limiting & Error Messages

## Overview
This document describes the user experience enhancements made to provide clear, actionable error messages when users encounter rate limits, storage quotas, or file size restrictions.

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### Backend Error Response Format
All error responses now follow a consistent, structured format:

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable error title",
  "message": "Detailed, actionable message for users",
  "code": "ERROR_TYPE_CODE",
  "type": "ERROR_TYPE",
  "retry_after": 1,  // For rate limiting
  "limit": 2,        // For rate limiting
  "window": 1,       // For rate limiting
  "current_storage": 8312190,  // For storage errors
  "max_storage": 10485760,     // For storage errors
  "file_size": 52428800,       // For file size errors
  "max_file_size": 10485760    // For file size errors
}
```

### Frontend Error Handling
Enhanced all frontend components to:
- **Detect rate limiting errors** and show user-friendly alerts
- **Parse error details** from backend responses
- **Display specific guidance** for each error type
- **Show retry timeframes** when applicable

## üéØ Error Types & User Messages

### 1. Rate Limiting (HTTP 429)
**When triggered:** User exceeds 2 API calls per second (configurable)

**Backend Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests. You have exceeded the limit of 2 calls per 1 second(s). Please try again later.",
  "code": "RATE_LIMIT_ERROR",
  "type": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "retry_after": 1,
  "limit": 2,
  "window": 1
}
```

**Frontend Alert:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limit exceeded. Please wait 1 second(s) before trying again.

Too many requests. You have exceeded the limit of 2 calls per 1 second(s). Please try again later.
```

### 2. Storage Quota Exceeded (HTTP 403)
**When triggered:** User's total storage exceeds 10 MB limit (configurable)

**Backend Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Storage quota exceeded",
  "message": "You have used 9.8 MB of your 10.0 MB storage limit. Please delete some files to free up space before uploading more.",
  "code": "STORAGE_QUOTA_EXCEEDED",
  "type": "STORAGE_QUOTA_EXCEEDED",
  "current_storage": 10276659,
  "max_storage": 10485760
}
```

**Frontend Alert:**
```
üíæ Storage quota exceeded!

You have used 9.8 MB of your 10.0 MB storage limit. Please delete some files to free up space before uploading more.
```

### 3. File Size Exceeded (HTTP 413)
**When triggered:** Single file exceeds 10 MB limit (configurable)

**Backend Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "File too large",
  "message": "File size is 50.0 MB, which exceeds the maximum allowed size of 10.0 MB per file. Please choose a smaller file.",
  "code": "FILE_SIZE_EXCEEDED",
  "type": "FILE_SIZE_EXCEEDED",
  "file_size": 52428800,
  "max_file_size": 10485760
}
```

**Frontend Alert:**
```
üìÅ File too large!

File size is 50.0 MB, which exceeds the maximum allowed size of 10.0 MB per file. Please choose a smaller file.
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### Frontend Components Enhanced
1. **Dashboard.tsx** - Stats fetching with rate limit alerts
2. **FileList.tsx** - File/folder listing with rate limit handling
3. **FileUpload.tsx** - Upload operations with all error types

### Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
if (response.status === 429) {
  const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({}));
  const retryAfter = errorData.retry_after || 1;
  alert(`‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limit exceeded. Please wait ${retryAfter} second(s) before trying again.\n\n${errorData.message || 'Too many requests.'}`);
}
```

### Backend Middleware Stack
1. **CORS** - Cross-origin handling
2. **Rate Limiting** - Per-user API call limits
3. **Authentication** - JWT token validation
4. **Storage Quota** - Per-user storage enforcement
5. **File Size Limits** - Per-file size enforcement

## üé® User Experience Features

### Visual Indicators
- **‚ö†Ô∏è** for rate limiting warnings
- **üíæ** for storage-related issues
- **üìÅ** for file size problems
- **‚ùå** for general errors
- **‚úÖ** for success messages

### Actionable Guidance
- **Clear timeframes** - "Please wait 1 second(s)"
- **Specific limits** - "2 calls per 1 second(s)"
- **Storage details** - "9.8 MB of your 10.0 MB limit"
- **File size info** - "50.0 MB exceeds 10.0 MB limit"

### Error Recovery
- **Automatic retry suggestions** with specific wait times
- **Storage management guidance** for quota issues
- **File selection hints** for size problems

## üß™ Testing Results

The implementation was tested with:
- **Rapid API requests** - Successfully triggers rate limiting with clear messages
- **Large file uploads** - Properly blocks and explains file size limits  
- **Storage quota checks** - Accurately calculates and reports storage usage
- **Error message format** - Consistent JSON structure across all error types

## üìä Configuration Options

All limits are configurable via environment variables:
- `RATE_LIMIT_CALLS=2` - API calls per window
- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=1` - Time window in seconds
- `STORAGE_QUOTA=10485760` - Storage limit in bytes (10 MB)
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760` - File size limit in bytes (10 MB)

## ‚ú® Benefits

1. **User-Friendly** - Clear, non-technical error messages
2. **Actionable** - Specific guidance on how to resolve issues
3. **Informative** - Detailed context about limits and usage
4. **Consistent** - Standardized error response format
5. **Professional** - Polished user experience with helpful alerts

This implementation ensures users understand exactly what went wrong and how to fix it, greatly improving the overall user experience of the file storage system.
