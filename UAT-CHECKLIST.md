## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Services not starting**: Check Docker containers with `docker-compose ps`
2. **Authentication failures**: Verify admin user credentials in database
3. **File upload failures**: Check storage permissions and quota settings
4. **API timeouts**: Verify network connectivity and service health

### Debug Commands
```powershell
# Check service health
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend

# Test basic connectivity
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/health" -Method GET
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000" -Method GET

# Run diagnostics
.\uat-api-tests.ps1 -Verbose
```

## üìä Test Execution Summary

After completing all tests, generate a summary report:

```powershell
# Run comprehensive test suite
.\uat-api-tests.ps1 -Verbose > uat-results.txt

# Generate test report
$testResults = Get-Content uat-results.txt
$passedTests = ($testResults | Select-String "‚úÖ PASS").Count
$failedTests = ($testResults | Select-String "‚ùå FAIL").Count
$totalTests = $passedTests + $failedTests
$passRate = [math]::Round(($passedTests / $totalTests) * 100, 2)

Write-Host "UAT Test Summary:" -ForegroundColor Blue
Write-Host "Total Tests: $totalTests" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "Passed: $passedTests" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Failed: $failedTests" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "Pass Rate: $passRate%" -ForegroundColor $(if ($passRate -ge 90) { "Green" } else { "Yellow" })
```

**‚úÖ UAT Completion Criteria**: All critical functionality tests must pass with a minimum 90% pass rate for production readiness.
